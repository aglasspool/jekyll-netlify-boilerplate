  TFL is struggling for survival. The COVID pandemic has destroyed its business model and forced it to rely on government handouts for its day-to-day survival.


  The Bakerloo line extension will not be happening any time soon.


  An alternative plan is needed to regenerate the Old Kent Road.


  An alternative which is not predicated on speculative housing developments for overseas investors and which ends up displacing the existing low-income community as a result of rising rents.


  An alternative, more organic and sustainable approach is required at lower cost and with much less disruption.


  Instead of a tube line we propose a tram link between New Cross and the Elephant and Castle.


  Old Kent Road is particularly suited to a tram link because of its width and lack of bends.
